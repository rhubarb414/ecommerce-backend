# mySQL E-commerce Back End

## Description

This is the server side code for controlling inventory for an e-commerce platform. It can be used to perform CRUD operations on categories, products, and product tags.

This project helped me to develop my undestanding of mySQL database relationships and api calls.

## Installation

After downloading the repo, run the schema from the command line by opening your mySQL and then using the command:

`SOURCE <schema-file-path>;`

You'll then exit mySQL and run `npm run seed` from the root to seed the newly created database.

Then go back into mysql and run `USE ecommerce_db;` to select the database you just seeded.

## Usage

From there you can run your commands through apps like Insomnia to perform CRUD operations on your categories, products, and product tags. View the demo video here:
